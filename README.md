## Description

my5G-RANTester is a tool for emulating control and data planes of the UE (user equipment) and gNB (5G base station). my5G-RANTester follows the 3GPP Release 15 standard for NG-RAN (Next Generation-Radio Access Network). Using my5G-RANTester, it is possible to generate different workloads and test several functionalities of a 5G core, including its complaince to the 3GPP standards. Scalability is also a relevant feature of the my5G-RANTester, which is able mimic the behaviour of a large number of UEs and gNBs accessing simultaneously a 5G core. Currently, the wireless channel is not implemented in the tool.
